Adventure Guide

Everyone loves to adventure. Adventure Guide provides a map to where you can do outdoor activities near a location of your choosing.

Check out a walkthrough of our app here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrO7-P8POKg&feature=youtu.be

Our current deployed version is here: http://captnseagraves-adventure-guide.surge.sh/

The Adventure Guide App maps out where users can do outdoor activities. Upon visiting the site, users will land on the splash page, where they will click on the "The Guidebook" button to access the map page. Once on the map page, the users can allow the website to access their current location. A red marker will appear on the map displaying their current location. They can then choose which activities they want to have mapped and click the "Use My Location" button. Results for the activities selected will be displayed within the range selected near their location. The user can also enter a City, State or Zip Code, and get results for that location. A bonus feature is the meteors selection, which displays the last 1000 meteors to hit the Earth and have been catalog by NASA.
